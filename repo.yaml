    summary: |
      The COPR API privides easy-to-use libraries to access data from the [{{copr.nameAndAcronym}}]({{copr.url}}).  These libraries are currently available for Javascript and Python.
    installation: |
      To install and build the libraries, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as well as [Python3](https://www.python.org) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io).  Then, run
      ```bash
      yarn install
      yarn build
      ```

      You can test the libraries by running
      ```bash
      yarn test
      ```

      The commands `install`, `build`, `watch`, `test`, and possibly some further ones are provided individually for each library.

      ## Installation: copr.js

      To install and build the library, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).  To install the production version, run
      ```bash
      yarn add copr.js # add package from npm to a your project
      ```
      
      Alternatively, you can install the local version included in this repository by running
      ```bash
      cd copr.js
      yarn install
      yarn build # build for production
      yarn watch # build for development
      ```

      ## Installation: copr.py

      To install the package, you will need [Python3](https://www.python.org) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io).  To install the production version, run
      ```bash
      pip3 install copr.py # install package from PyPI
      ```
      
      Alternatively, you can install the local version included in this repository by running
      ```bash
      cd copr.py
      yarn run install # install for production
      yarn run install:dev # install for development (with tests)
      ```
      or alternatively
      ```bash
      cd copr.py
      pip3 install . # install for production
      pip3 install -e . # install for development
      ```

      You can test the package by installing the corresponding dependencies
      ```bash
      pip3 install .[test] # local
      pip3 install copr[test] # from PyPI
      ```
      and then running
      ```bash
      pytest --verbose
      ```
